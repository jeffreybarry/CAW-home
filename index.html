    <h2>Cares About Wildlife is an online biodiversity curriculum aligned with the Common Core Standards.</h2>
    <p>  Crafted for grades 4-8, <span class="brand-name">Cares About Wildlife</span> helps young minds grow by taking kids on an educational journey into the woodland environment of the gray wolf.<p>

    <p>Creativity is an essential part of the learning process.</p>
    <p>Through the Cares About Wildlife learning activities, students build an interactive learning notebook showcasing their knowledge about wildlife.</p>

    <p><span class="brand-name">Cares About Wildlife</span> is inspired by my young daughter's love of animals. At age 10, she knows that she wants to teach people about the importance of animals when she grows up. But she struggles with math and science in school, partly because the context of the STEM assignments don't interest her.</p>
    <p>As an educator, I know that context is an important motivator for learning. I started creating a set of learning activities centered on one her favorite animals: wolves.</p>
    <p>In exploring the Common Core standards, I realized that every standard can pertain to a learning context focused on biodiversity.</p>
    <p>Too many kids, especially girls, turn away from STEM at some point in their schooling.</p>
    <div class="container-fluid section-3">

    <h3><span class="brand-name">Cares About Wildlife</span> mission</h3>
    <p> nurture the scientific mindset among kids by tapping into their common interest in animals.</p>
